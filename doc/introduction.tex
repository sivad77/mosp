\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
 
A manufacturer makes a variety of products that are ordered by a number of
customers in many combinations. However, the factory only has one machine which
is capable of producing one batch of a specific product at a time. Once the
first product of a customer's order is produced, a stack is opened to which
subsequent products in that order are stored. Following the completion of the
last product, the stack is closed and products are shipped to the customer. Due
to limited space in the factory, care must be taken to minimise the maximum
number of simultaneous orders, hence to minimise the maximum number of open
stacks.

Our ability to minimise the number of open stacks comes from finding an optimal
schedule in which the products are to be produced. For example, if customers
can choose from 10 products, it would yield 10! possible schedules. Our aim is
to find the minimum number of open stacks for a given problem using the maximum
of 100 products and 100 customers by employing a dynamic programming approach.
