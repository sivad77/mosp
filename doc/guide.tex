\section{Guide to Using Software}

The mosp utility runs both preprocessing and the search algorithm on a given
problem instance and reports, statistics and the solution if obtained.

It has many command line arguments, based on a command line interface:

mosp flags problemFile

If no flags are specified or only -h is used, mosp will print flags which turn
on different search algorithms, among other features.

The following example represents using subsumption and partitioning to solve a
problem instance using the stepwise algorithm

mosp -dps problem
