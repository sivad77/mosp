\section{Testing}

The testing was performed according to the following schemes. Depending on
flags used during compilation, debugging, assertion and verbose output may be
enabled. I am confident that all the primitive functions are correct. 

	All data type methods were given strict behaviour on all inputs, that
is boundary cases were identified and delt with elegantly (some instances the
program terminates with an assertion). Unfortunately, in some complex functions
the program terminates with an assertion due to speed considerations and shows
the line number and source file where the program failed. This is not enough
information in many cases to identify what caused the failure so extra
information is included in the source code before the assertion describing why
the assertion should be true.

	All primitive methods were extensively checked, with each boundary
cases tested. The set library went under even more extensive tests, using
randomly generated sets and testing relational, algebraic and special cases as
this is the most used DT.

	Due to lack of time, many higher order function lacked specific testing
functions, but as these methods are built upon the primitive methods, we can
reason that is the logic is sound the behaviour of the function must be
correct.
